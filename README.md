# FinTech Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of the company: **Robinhood/Robinhood Markets**

* According to the **Robinhood Markets Wikipedia page** here: [Robinhood Wikipedia](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-wikipedia]), Robinhood was incorporated April 18th, 2013. And on *July 28, 2021* Robinhood went public with an initial public offering of $*38* per share.

* According to the **Robinhood Markets Wikipedia page** here: [Robinhood Wikipedia](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-wikipedia]), "Robinhood was founded in April 2013 by **Vladimir Tenev** and **Baiju Bhatt**...". The two founders met at Stanford University, and after a breif stint working in FinTech in New York City, the pair moved back to California to start Robinhood.

* According to the **Robinhood Our Story Page** here: [Robinhood Our Story](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-our-story) the idea for Robinhood came up when: "[**Vladimir Tenev** and **Baiju Bhatt**]...realized that big Wall Street firms pay effectively nothing to trade stocks, while most Americans were charged commission for every trade. They soon decided it was more important to build products that would provide everyone with access to the financial markets, not just the wealthy. Two years after heading to New York, they moved back to California and built Robinhood—a company that leverages technology to encourage everyone to participate in our financial system." The way they do this is by both not charging commissions as well as having a more accessible mobile application.

* According to an article from **SeekingAlpha** and by *Kent Thune*: [Robinhood Revenues](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-revenues) Robinhood is funded by ***User Transactions, Subscriber Fees, Stock Loans/Margin Trading, Cash Management Fees, Income from Cash and Fees on Transfers/other Services***. Beyond these sources of income, another source of income for Robinhood is payment-for-order-flow. And according to **Crunchbase** here: [Robinhood Crunchbase (Financials)](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-cb-financials) "Robinhood has raised **$6.2 Billion** over *27 rounds* and their latest round of funding was raised on *May 13, 2022* from a ***Post-IPO Secondary round***". This makes Robinhood one of the largest brokerage firms in the world, corroborated by this article here: [Largest Brokerage Firms](https://tinyurl.com/largest-brokerage-firms).


## Business Activities

* According to this **CNBC** article by *Julia Boorstin* here: [CNBC Article](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-disruptive) "The company has removed barriers to trading by making investing commission-free and mobile-first. It has simplified investing, and made it more accessible and personal". As previously discussed, the lack of commission fees and the mobile-first application has galvanized and broken down barriers for a customer base of mostly young and inexperienced traders.

* According to this **New York Times** article by *Nathaniel Popper* here: [NY Times Article](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-customers) "Robinhood’s average customer is young and lacks investing know-how. The average age is 31, the company said, and half of its customers had never invested before". And according to ***Robinhood's*** **Q2 2022 Results Report** here: [Robinhood Q2 Report](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-Q2-2022) "Net Cumulative Funded Accounts were 22.9 million, an increase of 100 thousand sequentially. Monthly Active Users (MAU) decreased 1.9 million sequentially to 14.0 million for June 2022, as customers navigated the volatile market environment". Even though Robinhood has 22.9 millions customer accounts, their competitors like ***Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments*** and even ***Coinbase*** have much more customers and assets according to this article on **The Ascent by Motley Fool** written by *Lyle Daly*: [Largest Brokerage Firms](https://tinyurl.com/largest-brokerage-firms).

* The somewhat unfair advantage that Robinhood has had from its inception is that unlike some of thier competitors such as ***Charles Schwab, Fidelity Investments, E-TRADE, and TD Ameritrade*** , Robinhood does not charge its customers commissions. Another advantage Robinhood has is the fact that they allow trading through a mobile application, which many of its competitors listed above do not have. This has amde trading much more accessible and streamling for their customers that are either new to trading or can not afford to use a desktop application as well as commission fees.

* The technologies used to implement Robinhood's applications can be seen below in an image from **StackShare** linked here: [Robinhood Stackshare](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-stackshare). Some of the major technologies include Meta's React for Front-End development, PostgresSQL as a Database, ElasticSearch & ELK for indexed searching and logging, Docker for containerization, Jenkins automation servers, and Slack for communication. ![Robinhood Tech Stack](./assets/Robinhood-Tech-Stack.png)


## Landscape

* According to an artcle on **Investopedia** by *Matthew Johnston* here: [Investopedia Robinhood](https://tinyurl.com/robinhood-investopedia) "Robinhood is an ***online discount brokerage*** that offers a commission-free investing and trading platform". And though many brokerages provide trading platoform such as *Chales Schwab's StreetSmart Edge* platform, most are not like Robinhood in the fact that they provide a mobile-first platform without commission fees.

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years?

* According to this article on **The Ascent by Motley Fool** written by *Lyle Daly*: [Largest Brokerage Firms](https://tinyurl.com/largest-brokerage-firms) some of Robinhoods major competitors include ***Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Coinbase, Ally Invest, Vanguard and J.P. Morgan***. Through the illustration of some of the graphs, we can tell that Robinhood is 5th in AUM, 4th in market size as well as average assets per client.
